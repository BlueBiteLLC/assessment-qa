## User Story

---

### User Story

**As a** Brand Manager
**I want** the ability for my customers to entry a raffle
**So that** I can have continue engagement with our products

### Detailed Description

The customer will be presented with an experience where they have the chance to enter a raffle to win a pair of sneakers provided by the brand. To enter the raffle they need to fill out a form capturing:
* Name
* Age (must be 18 or older)
* Validate Email
* Reason (optional)

There is no limit to the amount of times a customer can enter the raffle. Upon successful completion, the customer will be provided messaging that the submission was successful and how many times they have entered the raffle. For the customer to enter any subsequent submission they must reload the page. The submission count will be based on the device the user submits it on, so customers can submit different emails. If the customer is not 18 or older they will be presented with messaging stating they are not old enough. In that event submissions should not be saved through our raffle provider.

The winner of the raffle will be managed independently and will be contacted via email.
